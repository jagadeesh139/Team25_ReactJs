          <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a
            whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world,
            including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often
            described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.[2]
            During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive
            reality, organized and moved by divine laws</p>
