                Some social analysts have termed the Covid19 pandemic as a great equaliser. Yes, equaliser it definitely is – <br>touching the different strata of society with seemingly equal velocity. I prefer to call it an incessant gale playing havoc with the lives and lifestyles of people across the globe, but definitely not in equal measure. As always, the vulnerability of population placed at the margins of social structures was heightened. Besides the migrant workers, these marginalised sections are people from the queer and LGBT groups, persons with disabilities, and sex workers. Interestingly, persons with disabilities can be identified at the intersections of these different identities as it cuts across class, gender identities, and professions. This piece primarily revolves around the lived experiences of persons with disabilities and their families during the Covid19 pandemic.

Disability is not a homogeneous sector, or experience. <blockquote>Each category of impairment is characterised by a unique physical, sensory and intellectual limitation that is specific to that disability group. </blockquote> two individuals within the same disability group may have different kinds of limitations, and may require different kinds of support.
