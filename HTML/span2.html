    <p>Topic sentences are similar to<em> mini</em> thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the <sub>main point</sub> of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, <del>a topic sentence has a unifying function.</del> But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. <span style="color: brown;">An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate</span> to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: <span id="secondspan">Not all paragraphs need topic </span>sentences. In particular, <span id="thirdspan">opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different</span> functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.</p>
