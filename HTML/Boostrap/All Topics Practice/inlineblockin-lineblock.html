    <p>CSS Grid is a layout system that <span style="display: inline; color: aqua;">divides the webpage </span>into the grid of the rows and columns, where you can place
        items precisely within this grid. It can gives the more flexibility and control over how the elements are
        displayed on the webpage. <span style="display: block; width: 200px height: 100px;">CSS Grid can be used to </span>create the responsive layouts that adapt to the different
        screen sizes, making it a perfect choice for the modern web development.

        CSS Grid introduces the few new <span style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; height: 200px; background-color: aquamarine;">concepts such as the grid containers</span> and grid items, where the parent element is
        the grid container, and the children are the grid items.</p>
