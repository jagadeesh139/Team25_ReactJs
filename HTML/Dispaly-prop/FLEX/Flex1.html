            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a
                whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world,
                including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often
                described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.[2]
                During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive
                reality, organized and moved by divine laws.</p>
